# TrollTyper
A nifty tool to easily convert text to a Homestuck styled typing quirk. All that is needed to convert is pesterlog-esk text in a file or pasted in the program.

Adding new quirks is just creating a new class inheriting from TypingQuirk, adding some replacements, general info like chathandle and color and adding it to the list of quirks.
